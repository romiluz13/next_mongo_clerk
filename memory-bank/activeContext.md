# Active Context

> Tracks current state, recent changes, and next steps for open-source and AI onboarding.

## Current Work Focus
- Provide a ready-to-use, open-source starter for Next.js, Mongoose, and Clerk
- Maintain clear documentation and onboarding context
- Ensure all example code (home page, dashboard, API, model, test) is safe to delete and does not block any use case

## Recent Changes
- Bootstrapped Next.js app (TypeScript, app directory)
- Installed Mongoose and Clerk packages
- Created memory bank and docs folders
- Added initial documentation to memory bank and docs
- Added minimal home page example (safe to delete)
- Added TypeScript types to example API (non-blocking)
- Added instructions for removing all example code in README
- (Planned) Add minimal test setup for demonstration (safe to delete)
- Integrated Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for modern, customizable UI components.
- Setup was performed with minimal changes to existing code and structure.
- All config files (tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js, globals.css) follow best practices and are clean.

## Next Steps
- Extend with your own models, routes, and UI as needed
- Update documentation as your project evolves
- Continue to keep the project clean, general, and extensible
- Contribute improvements back to the open-source community!
- Prefer shadcn components for new UI features for consistency and modern design.
- Keep custom styles minimalâ€”use Tailwind utility classes and shadcn's design tokens.
- Only refactor existing UI to shadcn when already modifying that part of the code.
- For new features, default to shadcn components, but keep the UI minimal and focused.

## Principle
- Minimal change, maximum impact: Gradual, thoughtful adoption of shadcn for a clean, future-proof codebase.
