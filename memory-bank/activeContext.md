# Active Context

> Tracks current state, recent changes, and next steps for open-source and AI onboarding.

## Current Work Focus
- Provide a ready-to-use, open-source starter for Next.js, Mongoose, and Clerk
- Maintain clear documentation and onboarding context
- Ensure all example code (home page, dashboard, API, model, test) is safe to delete and does not block any use case

## Recent Changes
- Bootstrapped Next.js app (TypeScript, app directory)
- Installed Mongoose and Clerk packages
- Created memory bank and docs folders
- Added initial documentation to memory bank and docs
- Added minimal home page example (safe to delete)
- Added TypeScript types to example API (non-blocking)
- Added instructions for removing all example code in README
- (Planned) Add minimal test setup for demonstration (safe to delete)

## Next Steps
- Extend with your own models, routes, and UI as needed
- Update documentation as your project evolves
- Continue to keep the project clean, general, and extensible
- Contribute improvements back to the open-source community!
