# Progress

> Summarizes what works, what's left, and current status for open-source and AI onboarding.

## What Works
- Next.js app bootstrapped with TypeScript and app directory
- Mongoose and Clerk packages installed
- Memory bank and docs folders created
- Initial documentation in memory bank and docs
- Minimal home page, dashboard, example model, and API (all safe to delete)
- TypeScript types in example API (non-blocking)

## What's Left to Build
- Add minimal test setup for demonstration (safe to delete)
- Continue to keep the project clean, general, and extensible
- Add more documentation or examples as your project grows

## Current Status
- Starter is ready for anyone to clone and begin building
- All examples are opt-in and do not block any use case

## Known Issues
- None (template is ready for use)
