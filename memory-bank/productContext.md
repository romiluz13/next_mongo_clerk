# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

- Lack of clear, AI-friendly documentation for onboarding

## How It Works
- Clone the repo
- Add required environment variables for MongoDB and Clerk
- Run `npm run dev` and everything works out of the box
- AI assistants and onboarding tools can reference the docs for context

## User Experience Goals
- Zero-configuration start (after .env)
- Clean, understandable codebase
- Fast onboarding for any developer or team
- AI-friendly documentation structure
