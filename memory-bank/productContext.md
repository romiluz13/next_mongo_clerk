# Product Context

> Explains the "why" behind this starter, for open-source users and AI onboarding.

## Why This Project Exists
Developers often spend time setting up the same boilerplate for every new Next.js project with MongoDB and authentication. This open-source starter eliminates repetitive setup, enabling anyone to start building instantly.

## Problems Solved
- Tedious initial setup for Next.js, MongoDB, and Clerk
- Inconsistent integration patterns
- Lack of clear, AI-friendly documentation for onboarding

## How It Works
- Clone the repo
- Add required environment variables for MongoDB and Clerk
- Run `npm run dev` and everything works out of the box
- AI assistants and onboarding tools can reference the docs for context

## User Experience Goals
- Zero-configuration start (after .env)
- Clean, understandable codebase
- Fast onboarding for any developer or team
- AI-friendly documentation structure

## User Experience Goal
- Instantly modern and "vibe coder" friendly, but never cluttered.
- Users should recognize shadcn's clean, minimal design language, but the app should still feel unique to the brand.
- The app should feel future-proof, easy to extend, and ready for rapid prototyping or production.
