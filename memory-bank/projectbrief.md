## Project Name
Next.js + MongoDB (Mongoose) + Clerk Starter Template

## Purpose
A public, open-source starter for building modern web apps with Next.js (latest), MongoDB (via Mongoose), and Clerk authentication. Designed for anyone to clone and start building immediatelyâ€”just add your environment variables and go.

## Core Features
- Next.js (latest, App Router, TypeScript)
- MongoDB integration using Mongoose
- Clerk authentication (Next.js SDK)
- Minimal, clean, and extensible codebase
- Out-of-the-box support for .env configuration
- Comprehensive documentation for setup and usage
- AI-assist docs folder for onboarding and automation

## Out of Scope
- UI frameworks (e.g., Tailwind, Material UI)
- Non-Clerk authentication providers
- Non-Mongoose MongoDB drivers

## Success Criteria
- Any developer can clone the repo, add .env, and run the app with working MongoDB and Clerk integration
- Clear, open documentation and code structure for easy onboarding
