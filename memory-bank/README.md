# Memory Bank

This folder contains structured project context for AI assistants, onboarding, and future contributors.

- **Purpose:**
  - Help AI tools (like Cursor) understand and extend the project efficiently
  - Provide clear onboarding for new developers
  - Track architecture, tech stack, patterns, and project state

- **How to use:**
  - Update these files as the project evolves
  - Use as a reference for architecture, decisions, and next steps
  - Safe to publish and share—no secrets or sensitive data
  - **Not required:** You can delete the memory bank if you want a totally clean slate, or keep/update it for team/AI onboarding.

- **For AI tools (like Cursor):**
  - The memory bank is a recommendation, not a requirement.
  - If you use Cursor, consider adding these memory bank rules to your `.cursorrules` for best AI-driven development.
  - The memory bank is designed to help you start any real app—not to build more templates.
